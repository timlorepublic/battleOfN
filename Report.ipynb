    "#### 1.1. Idea\n",
    "Covid-19 virus spreads globally, affecting most, if not all, countries in the world. Canada is also one of the country affected by Covid-19. Based on recent data, Canada has 40,190 positive cases (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/canada/). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on the analysis of positive cases in the province of Ontario. In Ontario province alone, based on the data retrieved on 22nd April 2020, there were 12,245 positive cases. This corresponds to approximately 30% of the total case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to analyze the region's characteristic in Ontario by using Foursquare location data which may contribute to the Covid-19 spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Interest\n",
    "Some countries in the world are quite successful in containing the Covid-19 spread, and unfortunately some are not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the countries which are quite successful at the moment, they implement an aggresive measure by closing some public gathering places, requesting their citizen to do social distancing, limiting people mobility and also closing the borders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the broad topic, the goal of the project here is to help relevant stakeholders in Ontario by finding out which region's characteristic has bigger impact and whether social distancing measure really helps in limiting the spread"
